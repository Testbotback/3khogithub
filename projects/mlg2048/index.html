				<p>
					Ayy lmao, welcome to the dankest Major League Gaming
					version of 2048. Here you can get a taste of what it feels
					like being an absolute no-scoping hero of your parent's
					internet.

					Be advised that this game is only intended for a
					professional audience.

				<h2>How to play</h2>
				<p>
					2048 is a game where you move numbered squares around to
					combine them into blocks with a higher value. Every time you
					make a move, a new square with a low value is added to the
					board. This leads to the board becoming filled up pretty
					quickly. When no more moves are possible, you lose! The goal is
					to reach a square with a value of 2048.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are playing on a computer: drag your mouse pointer
					across the board while holding down the left button in the
					direction you want the tiles to move. You can also use the
					arrow keys instead.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are playing on a touchscreen: use any finger or
					bodypart you want to swipe the tiles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ready? Good luck!
				</p>

				<h2>Controls</h2>
				<p>
					You can use swipe gestures to move around using your cursor or
					fingers if you are playing on a touch-screen.
				</p>

				<h2>Strategy and Tips</h2>
				<p>
					If you feel like you have spent enough time combining squares
					while trying to reach 2048, here are some tips that will help
					you out:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The board will get fuller with every move you make. It
						is vital to keep combining the squares to give yourself
						space to keep going.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep your squares wth high values in a single corner.
						This eliminates unusable space on the board that you so
						desperately need to keep playing.
					</li>
					<li>
						Identify squares that are in the way and think in
						advance how you will get rid of them.
					</li>
					<li>
						Resist the urge to combine squares with a large value,
						especially if this goes against tip 2. You might end up
						combining the squares at the expense of a good board
						layout.
					</li>
				</ol>
